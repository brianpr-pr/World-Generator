Add input for amount of squares and porcentage of squares that should be part of the map and 
create the map dinamically, this has to still be responsive...

Validate if the the input data is correct and the creation of the map is possible (Example the user can't set minimum zones of nature to be 1.000.000 and the number of squares to 100).

Add to the algorithm the option of creating a square in the top right/left or bottom right/left position

Add to the algorithm that for each new painted square it will assign a number corresponding to a zone and a color from the three categories (nature, urban, commerce).

Modify the borders of the painted squares so they will only have a border if its not facing a painted squares, so the border will be around the whole map rather that each small square with the 4 borders.
